### Lesson 3: How to Do Open Science

#### Overview
This lesson introduces important security and privacy considerations for scientists when sharing information. Next, the lesson discusses how sharing information may impact different communities. Following this, the lesson explains the topic of intellectual property, how it can be protected, and the different types of licenses available to facilitate sharing while ensuring the owner of the information receives credit for their work. Lastly, this covers the effect of rules and regulations set by an organization, grant, or publisher on a scientist's options to make their research open access.

#### 3.1 Privacy and Security Considerations

**Why Privacy Matters**
- Research subject privacy must be protected
- Health information is sensitive and regulated
- Vulnerable populations need special protection
- Data security is essential

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
- Names, addresses, phone numbers, emails
- Birth dates, social security numbers
- Photographs, location data
- Health or genetic information

**Protecting Privacy While Staying Open:**

**De-identification Strategies:**
- Replace names with ID codes
- Report ranges instead of exact values
- Aggregate data to avoid individual identification
- Use synthetic datasets with same statistical properties

**Example:** Instead of "Patient name: Jane Smith, Age: 45, Condition: Depression," report "ID: SUB001, Age: 40-49, Condition: Mental health diagnosis"

**HIPAA Compliance (US Health Data):**
- Remove 18 specific identifiers
- De-identified data can be shared
- Aggregate statistics are safe
- Requires careful documentation

**Sensitive Data Categories:**
- **Security-related:** Infrastructure vulnerabilities, dangerous procedures
- **Proprietary:** Patent-pending discoveries, trade secrets
- **Location-based:** Endangered species locations, archaeological sites
- **Cultural:** Indigenous knowledge, sacred information

**Handling Sensitive Data:**
- Don't share publicly
- Use access agreements
- Delay publication for patents
- Obtain community consent for cultural knowledge
- Be transparent about restrictions

#### 3.2 Intellectual Property and Licensing

**What Is Intellectual Property?**
- Copyrights (written works, code, databases)
- Patents (inventions)
- Trademarks (brand names)
- Trade secrets (confidential information)

**Copyright Issues in Research:**
- Default: readers cannot copy, modify, or reuse without permission
- Solution: Use explicit licenses to enable appropriate sharing
- Clarify ownership: researcher, institution, or publisher?

**Patents and Open Science:**
- Patents restrict access and reuse
- But necessary for commercial development
- Strategy: File patents before publishing
- Eventually becomes public (20-year limit)

**Licensing Your Work:**

**For Maximum Reuse:**
- **CC0 (Public Domain):** Complete freedom, no restrictions (recommended for data)
- **CC BY (Attribution):** Free use, requires credit (recommended for writing/manuscripts)

**For Software:**
- **MIT License:** Permissive, minimal restrictions (very popular)
- **Apache 2.0:** Permissive with patent protection
- **GPL:** Requires derivatives remain open (more restrictive)

**License Selection Guide:**
- Data: CC0 or CC BY
- Academic writing: CC BY
- Software: MIT or Apache 2.0
- Educational resources: CC BY or CC BY-SA

#### 3.3 Funder and Institutional Constraints

**Funder Requirements:**

**NSF (National Science Foundation):**
- Data Management Plan required
- Data sharing required (exceptions noted)
- Public access to findings
- Timeline: Within 2 years of collection

**NIH (National Institutes of Health):**
- Data Management and Sharing Plan
- Data sharing encouraged (privacy/IP exceptions)
- Public access to research

**EU (Horizon 2020/Horizon Europe):**
- Open access mandate
- FAIR data principles
- Data repository required
- Exceptions for confidentiality

**Institutional Policies:**
- Copyright ownership varies (clarify before starting)
- Data storage requirements
- IP claim policies
- Self-archiving permissions

**Publisher Agreements:**

**Check Before Submitting:**
- Can I post preprints?
- When can I archive my manuscript?
- What version can I archive?
- What license applies?

**Tool:** Sherpa/RoMEO (sherpa.ac.uk/romeo) shows self-archiving policies

**Self-Archiving Rights:**
- **Green OA:** Often allowed after 6-24 month embargo
- **Gold OA:** Immediately open (may require author fees)
- **Preprints:** Usually allowed before/alongside publication

#### Summary

Doing open science responsibly means:
1. Protecting privacy through de-identification and access controls
2. Respecting intellectual property and using appropriate licenses
3. Understanding and navigating funder and institutional requirements
4. Being transparent about any restrictions
5. Balancing openness with necessary safeguards

### Lesson 4: When Not to Be Open

#### Overview
In this lesson, you will consider potential barriers to adopting open science practices. Barriers can come in the form of personal fears, as a result of misaligned social challenges, or institutional/infrastructure barriers. We discuss common barriers and mitigation strategies.

#### 4.1 Personal and Fear-Based Barriers

**Fear 1: "My work isn't good enough"**
- Reality: All research has limitations; transparency builds trust
- Solution: Start with one small open practice, get feedback, build confidence

**Fear 2: "I will be scooped"**
- Reality: Preprints establish timestamped priority; simultaneous discoveries are normal
- Evidence: Most important findings independently verified
- Solution: Post preprints early, collaborate rather than compete

**Fear 3: "I don't have time"**
- First project: +15-20% effort (learning curve)
- Subsequent projects: +5-10% effort
- Long-term: Time savings of 30-40% from building on others' work
- Solution: Document as you go, use templates, plan ahead

**Fear 4: "I'll be publicly shamed or attacked"**
- Reality: Constructive criticism improves work; personal attacks are rare
- Solution: Focus on feedback, ignore trolls, build supportive community

#### 4.2 Social and Cultural Barriers

**Skepticism from Peers**
- Colleagues may think open science is naive or risky
- Solution: Share evidence of benefits, lead by example, build allies

**Publish-or-Perish Culture**
- Pressure discourages thoroughness
- Reality: Preprints establish priority; open practices increasingly valued

**Prestige Journal Bias**
- High-impact journals traditionally not open
- Solution: High-quality OA journals now exist (eLife, Nature Communications, PLOS)
- Funders shifting from impact factor to quality

#### 4.3 Institutional and Infrastructure Barriers

**Limited Support**
- No institutional repositories
- Unclear copyright policies
- Limited technical support
- Solution: Use free tools (GitHub, Zenodo), advocate for institutional resources

**Technical Skills Gaps**
- Don't know Git/GitHub/data formats
- Solution: Free training widely available, collaborate with skilled colleagues, start simple

**Time and Cost Constraints**
- Open science takes effort
- OA publishing expensive ($1,000-$5,000/article)
- Solution: Plan ahead, use templates, request waivers, green OA option (free)

#### 4.4 Legitimate Reasons to Restrict Sharing

**Privacy and Security**
- Health data cannot be adequately de-identified
- Research subjects didn't consent to sharing
- Security vulnerabilities would be exposed
- Strategy: Protect while remaining transparent about methods

**Intellectual Property**
- Patent application pending
- Commercial development planned
- Strategy: File patents first, then publish; be transparent about timeline

**Safety Concerns**
- Research could be weaponized
- Infrastructure vulnerabilities
- Strategy: Review with security office, publish non-sensitive portions

**Cultural/Indigenous Knowledge**
- Community ownership claims
- Sacred or sensitive information
- Strategy: Obtain explicit community consent, honor OCAP principles

#### 4.5 Graduated Openness Approach

**Not All-or-Nothing:**

1. **Restricted Access:** Data available to requesters via data use agreements
2. **Embargoed Release:** Data private initially, released after specified period
3. **Tiered Access:** De-identified data open; identifiable data restricted
4. **Progressive Opening:** Start closed, open over time as appropriate

**Timeline Example:**
```
Month 0-24: Collect data, keep private
Month 24: Publish, release deidentified data
Month 36: Release identified data to approved researchers
Month 48: Full public release
```

#### Summary

Barriers are real but manageable:
- Personal barriers: Start small, find community, reframe concerns
- Social barriers: Lead by example, educate, build allies
- Infrastructure barriers: Use free tools, seek training, collaborate
- Systemic barriers: Advocate for change, support alternatives
- Legitimate restrictions: Balance with transparency through graduated openness
